## Honorable mentions

[JBis](//github.com/jbis9051) has written out [extensive (unofficial) documentation for chat](https://github.com/jbis9051/JamesSOBot/blob/master/docs/CHAT_API.md), which is among the only chat documentation in existence. Many chat implementations have their own documentation of varying quality, such as [ChatExchange (Python)](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/blob/12b3cc65683646afeb479b8289ca531bf66ec3ef/docs/se-chat-interface.md), but I'm not aware of any attempts to extensively document everything.

The only caveat is that the documentation is JS-centric, but those parts can be rewritten fairly trivially into any other language.

Stack themselves do not offer an official API, much less official documentation on how to do anything here. The foundations for JBis' documentation, as well as every chat library is overwhelmingly reverse engineering, and obviously other implementations who have already done a chunk of work on figuring out all of Stack's undocumented weirdness.

Even then, as indicated by the event list, there are a lot of unknowns.

This library will not attempt to write its own documentation on chat itself, seeing as JBis has one far more extensive than I can be bothered writing out.
